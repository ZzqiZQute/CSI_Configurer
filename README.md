# CSI_Configurer
Simplify Wi-Fi CSI Configure Process

## Notice

I used a server which listen at port 8899 to send the CSI data to the PC.This server can be connected only once at the same time unless you use the ![Dispatcher](https://github.com/ZzqiZQute/CSI_Dispatcher) which connect this server and open a new server which listen at 8900.
